# Kanna's Quality of Life

My friend gave me a list of things to improve the flow of gameplay. So I did.

This mod provides a list of toggleable quality of life changes (Everyone say thank you prod.). You can pick and choose the settings for all of these with the config

## Quality of Life changes

* Instant Scrapping and Printing
* Scrapper(s) in Bazaar (up to however many players there are)
* Ping Lunar Seers to see destination
* Teleporter instantly finishes charging after boss is killed, with time adjusted
* Guaranteed Cleansing Pool on Alphesian Sanctuary
* Only pet the glass frog once for deep void portal (cost configurable!)

## TODO

* Testing (hahaha.. good one)
* Add Pinging Red Chests / Newt Altars on stage start
* Rebalancing mobility items to appear as often as they did relative to when the game came out. Something I'm considering just for my runs.
* More to come soon on this? We'll see :)

### Special Thanks
* prod (Making config files work)
* Kanna
* Kevin (Scrapper in shop implementation)
* mrchous & Arbition (formulas for tele charge skip)
